The JiraHandler class is a tool that helps developers easily connect to Jira and perform common
operations like creating, updating, and managing issues or projects. If youâ€™ve ever used Jira
for tracking bugs, managing tasks, or following project progress, this class makes it simpler
to automate those activities using Python.

## Jira Handler Code
The JiraHandler connects to Jira using an email, API token, and organization details. This setup allows the program to
interact with Jira, making it easy to manage tasks, projects, and issues programmatically.

To set up Confluence with email, token, and organization access, you can follow these steps in the given <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account" target="_blank">link</a>.
>Set up Email, Token and Organisation as an environmental variable and run the following code. <br />

 ```python
 export ATLASSIAN_EMAIL = "**********"
 export ATLASSIAN_TOKEN = "*************"
 export ATLASSIAN_ORGANIZATION = "***************"
```

```python jira_handler.py
import os
import asyncio

from superagentx_handlers.atlassian.jira import JiraHandler


async def get_active_sprint():
    jira_handler = JiraHandler(
        email="<EMAIL>",
        token="<TOKEN>",
        organization="<ORGANIZATION>"
    )
    return await jira_handler.get_active_sprint(
        board_id=1,
        start=0,
        end=50
    )


async def main():
    res = await get_active_sprint()
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Result

```python jira
[<JIRA Sprint: name='WDVG Sprint 27',id=28>]
```
