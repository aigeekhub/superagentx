## Introduction
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a lightweight, open protocol designed to standardize how AI applications and
large language models (LLMs) interface with external tools, data sources, and services. It allows developers to
seamlessly integrate LLMs into broader software systems by defining a clear, extensible, and secure context interface.<br />

Think of MCP as a universal adapter for AI systems, enabling smooth interaction between models and the tools they
need â€” like local files, databases, or web services.

### Parameters:

| Attribute                          | Parameters                  | Description                                                                            |
| :--------------------              | :----------------           | :-------------------------------------                                                 |
| **Command** _(optional)_           | `command`                   | The command used to launch the MCP-compatible server. Default to `None`                |
| **MCP Args** _(optional)_          | `mcp_args`                  | Optional list of additional CLI arguments to pass to the server. Default to `None`     |
| **SSE Url**  _(optional)_          | `sse_url`                   | Optional Server-Sent Events (SSE) URL for streaming. Default to `None`                 |
| **Headers** _(optional)_           | `headers`                   | Optional HTTP headers to include in the request. Default to `None`                     |
| **ENV**    _(optional)_            | `env`                       | Optional environment variables to set when running the server. Default to `None`       |

### MCP Handler - STDIO
The STDIO handler communicates using the standard input and output streams of the operating system. This method is
typically used when integrating with command-line tools or subprocesses. The MCP (Modular Communication Protocol)
engine sends input to the handler through standard input (stdin) and reads the response from standard output (stdout).

```python
from superagentx.handlers.mcp import MCPHandler

mcp_handler = MCPHandler(
    command="uvx",
    mcp_args=["mcp-server-reddit"]
)
```

### MCP Handler - SSE
The SSE handler uses Server-Sent Events, a web-based communication protocol that allows the server to push real-time
updates to the client over a single HTTP connection. The handler remains connected and continuously sends events as
they become available, without the client having to request them each time.

```python
from superagentx.handlers.mcp import MCPHandler

mcp_handler = MCPHandler(
    sse_url="http://0.0.0.0:8080/sse"
)
```
