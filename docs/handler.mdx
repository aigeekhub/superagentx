We use the term "handler" interchangeably with "tool calling." While "tool calling" is sometimes used to refer
to the invocation of a single function. It contains the logic for managing particular operations, playing a
key role in organizing and carrying out tasks.

With the `BaseHandler` from `superagentx.handler.base`, you can create your own custom
<a href="/examples/create_handler" target='_blank'>handlers</a>.

Additionally, we also provide <a href="examples/handlers/aws/s3" target='_blank'>pre-built handlers</a> for various other
services and libraries.

### Tool:
A tool is a method or function that performs a specific action within a larger system. In this context,
tools are asynchronous functions that handle specific tasks, like fetching data from external APIs or
performing calculations. The @tool decorator marks these methods as tools that can be invoked by the system.

```python
from superagentx.handler.decorators import tool

class ExaHandler(BaseHandler):

    @tool
    async def search_contents(
            self,
            *,
            query: str,
            use_autoprompt: bool,
            num_results: int = 10,
            search_type: str | None = None
    ):
```
