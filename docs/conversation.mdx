# ðŸ§  Conversation with Memory

A **conversation with memory** is more than just talkâ€”it's connection.

This guide demonstrates how to create an AI conversation pipeline using the `superagentx` framework, with built-in support for **memory** and **conversation context** through a unique `conversation_id`.

The core idea is to enable an AI agent to **remember the flow of a conversation** using a memory component tied to a specific session.

## 1. Define the AI Handler Pipeline

The function `get_test_ai_handler_pipe` initializes the AI pipeline with:

- An LLM client (using OpenAI)
- A memory module to retain context
- A custom handler to manage LLM interactions
- An agent defined with a goal and role
- A pipeline (`AgentXPipe`) for integration into CLI/WebSocket/API interfaces

```python
import uuid
from superagentx.agent import Agent
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe
from superagentx.engine import Engine
from superagentx.llm import LLMClient
from superagentx.memory import Memory
from superagentx.prompt import PromptTemplate

from df_agentic_app.handlers.ai import AIHandler

async def get_test_ai_handler_pipe() -> AgentXPipe:
    # LLM Configuration
    llm_config = {
        'llm_type': 'openai'
    }
    llm_client = LLMClient(llm_config=llm_config)

    # Enable Memory
    memory = Memory(memory_config={"llm_client": llm_client})

    ai_handler = AIHandler(
        llm=llm_client,
        memory=memory
    )

    # Prompt Template
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate()

    # Create Engine
    ai_engine = Engine(
        handler=ai_handler,
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template
    )

    # Create Agents
    ai_agent = Agent(
        name='AI agent',
        goal="Get me the best results",
        role="You are the best at answering",
        llm=llm_client,
        prompt_template=prompt_template,
        engines=[ai_engine]
    )

    # Expose via pipe for interaction
    pipe = AgentXPipe(
        agents=[ai_agent],
        memory=memory
    )

    return pipe
```

## 2. Run a Conversation with Context

This example initializes a pipeline and runs a conversation with memory:

```python
import asyncio
import uuid

conversation_id = uuid.uuid4().hex  # Unique ID for tracking this conversation

async def main():

    conversation_pipe = await get_test_ai_handler_pipe()

    await conversation_pipe.flow(
        query_instruction="What is Agentic AI?",
        conversation_id=conversation_id  # Context maintained here
    )

    await conversation_pipe.flow(
        query_instruction="Give me real-world examples of Agentic AI applications?",
        conversation_id=conversation_id
    )

    await conversation_pipe.flow(
        query_instruction="How does memory improve AI conversations?",
        conversation_id=conversation_id
    )

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main_conversations())
```
---

âœ… **Supports contextual memory** per `conversation_id`
âœ… **Ideal for multi-turn chat experiences** across CLI, WebSocket, or RESTful APIs

remember the previous context if previous context is not empty otherwise response it'.

User Input: What is Agentic AI?

the goal of getting the best results by supplying a comprehensive understanding of Agentic AI.',
result='Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess a form of agency,
which means they are designed to act autonomously on behalf of users or stakeholders in an

outcomes. Unlike purely reactive or rule-based systems, agentic AI can adapt to new situations,
learn from interactions, and make complex decisions by considering various factors and potential

User Input: How does memory improve AI conversations?
Previous Context: []

    name='AI agent',
    agent_id='177fdd1a9704457b981bed5db33858fc',
reason='The Output_Context does not address the query about how memory improves AI conversations. Instead, it discusses Agentic AI and its applications,
which are not relevant to the query. The additional provided response outside the context clearly addresses how memory can enhance AI conversations by explaining
various aspects like context retention, personalization, learning from interactions, reducing repetition, and improved decision-making.
result="Memory can enhance AI conversations in several ways:\n\n1. **Context Retention**: Memory allows an AI to retain the context of an ongoing
conversation, enabling more coherent and contextually relevant responses. By remembering earlier interactions, an AI can more effectively follow a thread of
conversation and reference past exchanges to enhance the dialogue.\n\n2. **Personalization**: With memory, an AI can remember users' preferences, personal
details, previous questions, and feedback. This leads to personalized interactions, as the AI can tailor its responses based on individual user profiles or
specific user history.\n\n3. **Learning from Interactions**: Memory enables an AI to learn from past interactions and improve over time. As it stores information
about what worked well in previous conversations or where misunderstandings occurred, it can adapt its approach to become more effective in future
interactions.\n\n4. **Reducing Repetition**: By recalling earlier interactions, an AI can avoid repetitive questioning or information exchange, which improves
user experience. Users do not have to repeat themselves if the AI remembers what has already been discussed.\n\n5. **Improved Decision Making**: Memory allows an
AI to remember previous successes or failures, which can inform its decision-making processes. By leveraging past experiences, the AI can choose strategies that
are more likely to be effective in achieving desired outcomes.\n\nOverall, memory enhances the quality and effectiveness of AI conversations by adding continuity,
depth, and adaptability to interactions.",

## ðŸ§  Why Memory Matters

Memory enables **multi-turn conversations** where the AI doesn't forget previous questions, responses, or the conversation's purpose.

This is essential for building helpful and coherent AI assistants that feel **more natural** and **less robotic**.
