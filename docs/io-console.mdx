This documentation provides an overview of the code used to implement a console-based client for interacting
with the trip planner pipeline using SuperagentX. The client allows users to input search queries via the command
line interface (CLI) and receive results in real-time.

## Overview
The code sets up an interactive CLI using the IOPipe class from SuperagentX. The client allows users to enter a
search query, which is processed by the trip planner pipeline, and results are returned dynamically through the console interface.

## Setup Environment

```shell
$ pip install superagentx
```

Implementation

Import the dependencies.
```python
import asyncio

from rich import print as rprint
from superagentx.pipeimpl.iopipe import IOPipe

from trip_planner.pipe import get_trip_planner_pipe
```


The main function initializes the trip planner pipeline by calling the get_trip_planner_pipe function.
It then creates an IOPipe object, which serves as the console interface for interacting with the pipeline.
The read_prompt parameter customizes the prompt displayed to users when they are asked to input a query.

```python
async def main():
    """
    Launches the trip_planner pipeline console client for processing requests and handling data.
    """

    pipe = await get_trip_planner_pipe()

    # Create IO Cli Console - Interface
    io_pipe = IOPipe(
        search_name='SuperAgentX trip_planner',
        agentx_pipe=pipe,
        read_prompt=f"\n[bold green]Enter your search here"
    )
    await io_pipe.start()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        asyncio.run(main())
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, asyncio.CancelledError):
        rprint("\nUser canceled the [bold yellow][i]pipe[/i]!")
```

This IO console client provides a simple way for users to interact with the trip planner pipeline, entering search
queries and receiving immediate feedback through the command line interface.
