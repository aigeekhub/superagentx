An `Agent` from `superagentx.agent` is a system or program that is initialized with specific goals and roles, enabling it to interact with a
large language model (LLM) and use a predefined prompt template. It is designed to perform agent by following a
set of instructions and can be customized with various parameters to adapt its behavior to different agent or
workflows. Essentially, the `agent` acts as a flexible tool that can be fine-tuned to carry out specific functions
based on the needs of the user.

|**Agent ID** _(optional)_           | `agent_id`                  | A unique identifier for the engine. If not provided, a new UUID will be generated by default. Useful for tracking or referencing the engine in multi-engine environments.                    |
|**Name** _(optional)_               | `name`                      | An optional name for the engine, providing a more friendly reference for display or logging purposes.                                                                                        |
|**Description** _(optional)_        | `description`               | An optional description that provides additional context or details about the engine's purpose and capabilities.                                                                             |
|**Output Format** _(optional)_      | `output_format`             | Specifies the desired format for the engine's output. This can dictate how results are structured and presented.                                                                             |
|**Max Retry** _(optional)_          | `max_retry`                 | The maximum number of retry attempts for operations that may fail.Default is set to 5. This is particularly useful in scenarios where transient errors may occur, ensuring robust execution. |

## Agent Configuration

### Sequence
In sequence execution, `engine(s)` are performed one after another, with each `engine(s)` waiting for the
previous one to finish before starting. This approach is simple but can be slow if `engine(s)` are independent.

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...
    engines=[engine_1, engine_2, engine_3 ... engine_n],
    ...
)

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [engine_1, engine_2, engine_3 ... engine_n]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    ...
)

await agent.add(engine_1, engine_2, execute_type='SEQUENCE')
.
.
.
await agent.add(engine_3, engine_4, execute_type='SEQUENCE')
.
.

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [engine_1, engine_2, engine_3, engine_4]
```

### Parallel
In parallel execution, `engine(s)` run at the same time, speeding up the process by utilizing multiple threads or processes.

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...
    engines=[[engine_1, engine_2, engine_3 ... engine_n]],
    ...
)

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [[engine_1, engine_2, engine_3 ... engine_n]]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    ...
)

await agent.add(engine_1, engine_2, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.

await agent.add(engine_3, engine_4, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [[agent_1, engine_2, engine_3, engine_4]]
```

### Mixed with Sequence and Parallel

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...
    engines=[engine_1, [engine_2, engine_3], engine_4 ... engine_n],
    ...
)

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [engine_1, [engine_2, engine_3], engine_4, ... engine_nm]]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agent import agent

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    ...
)

await agent.add(engine_1, engine_2, execute_type='SEQUENCE')
.
.
.
await agent.add(engine_3, engine_4, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.

# Engines execution will be in following order
# [engine_1, engine_2, [engine_3, engine_4]]
```
