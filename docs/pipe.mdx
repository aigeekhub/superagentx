### AgentXPipe
The `AgentXPipe` class from the `superagentx.agentxpipe` module is used to set up a pipeline that allows multiple agents to work
together in sequence, Parallel or Hybrid. In this case, the `AgentXPipe` object enables the use of one or
more agents **_(e.g., ecom_agent, ai_agent, content_creator_agent etc..)_** in combination with a memory store,
allowing the system to persist context, share information between agents, and maintain state across multiple interactions.

### AgentXPipe Parameters
| Attribute                                     | Parameters                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|**Pipe Id** _(optional)_                       |`pipe_id`                    | A unique identifier for the agentxpipe. If not provided, a new UUID will be generated by default. Useful for tracking or referencing the agentxpipe in multi-engine environments.                                                                                                       |
|**Name** _(optional)_                          |`name`                       | An optional name for the agentxpipe, providing a more friendly reference for display or logging purposes.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|**Description**  _(optional)_                  |`description`                | An optional description that provides additional context or details about the agentxpipe's purpose and capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|**Agents**   _(optional)_                      |`agents`                     | A list of Agent instances (or lists of Agent instances) that are part of this structure. These agents can perform tasks and contribute to achieving the defined goal.                                                                                                                   |
|**Memory**   _(optional)_                      |`memory`                     | An optional memory instance that allows the engine to retain information across interactions.This can enhance the pipe's contextual awareness and improve its performance over time.                                                                                                    |
|**Stop if goal is not satisfied** _(optional)_ | `stop_if_goal_not_satisfied`| A flag indicating whether to stop processing if the goal is not satisfied. When set to True, the agentxpipe operation will halt if the defined goal is not met,preventing any further actions. Defaults to `False`, allowing the process to continue regardless of goal satisfaction.     |

## AgentXPipe Agent Configuration

### Sequence
In sequence execution, `agent(s)` are performed one after another, with each `agent(s)` waiting for the
previous one to finish before starting. This approach is simple but can be slow if `agent(s)` are independent.

```python
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe

pipe = AgentXPipe(
    ...
    agents=[agent_1, agent_2, agent_3 ... agent_n],
    ...
)

# Agents execution will be in following order
# [agent_1, agent_2, agent_3 ... agent_n]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe

pipe = AgentXPipe(
    ...,
    ...
)

await pipe.add(agent_1, agent_2)
.
.
.
await pipe.add(agent_3, agent_4, execute_type='SEQUENCE')
.
.

# Agents execution will be in following order
# [agent_1, agent_2, agent_3, agent_4]
```

### Parallel
In parallel execution, `agent(s)` run at the same time, speeding up the process by utilizing multiple threads or processes.

```python
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe

pipe = AgentXPipe(
    ...
    agents=[[agent_1, agent_2, agent_3 ... agent_n]],
    ...
)

# Agents execution will be in following order
# [[agent_1, agent_2, agent_3 ... agent_n]]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe

pipe = AgentXPipe(
    ...,
    ...
)

await pipe.add(agent_1, agent_2, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.
.
await pipe.add(agent_3, agent_4, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.

# Agents execution will be in following order
# [[agent_1, agent_2, agent_3, agent_4]]
```

### Mixed with Sequence and Parallel

```python
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe

pipe = AgentXPipe(
    ...
    agents=[agent_1, [agent_2, agent_3], agent_4 ... agent_n],
    ...
)

# Agents execution will be in following order
# [agent_1, [agent_2, agent_3], agent_4, ... agent_n]]
```

#### Alternate way of configure

```python
from superagentx.agentxpipe import AgentXPipe

pipe = AgentXPipe(
    ...,
    ...
)

await pipe.add(agent_1, agent_2, execute_type='SEQUENCE')
.
.
.
await pipe.add(agent_3, agent_4, execute_type='PARALLEL')
.
.

# Agents execution will be in following order
# [agent_1, agent_2, [agent_3, agent_4]]
```
